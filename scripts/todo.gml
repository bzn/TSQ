You may be wondering about the overall shoddiness of the game's code,
but I had to write this in three days, so I took whatever shortcuts
were available, and we didn't even plan to have multiple characters
from the start, let anyone gamepad support or options, and besides,
writing longer sentences that just run on and on like this is always fun.
